# MeLiCatalog

MeLiCatalog is a simple app that let's you search products on MercadoLibre Argentina. Built with SwiftUI, Combine and the Network framework, it also showcases Apple's latest technlogies.

## Running the app locally

To run the app, you just need xCode 12 or later, and an iOS 14 simulator or device. The app doesn't have any additional dependencies, it's simply build and run. Since it's a rather small app, I decided to avoid the overhead some third-party libraries come with (specially since I wasn't going to take advantage of most of the provided features), and just used the system provided tools.
